  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Amhera Mae Supnet</strong>, born on October 22, 2004. I’m proud to call Baguio City home—the cool, pine‑fringed heart of the Cordilleras.</p>
  <p>Being the <em>middle child</em> of three siblings taught me balance, patience, and the value of connection. Growing up, weekends at church grounded me in faith and community. I cherish those spiritual moments that keep me centered.</p>
  <p>Music flows through my veins—I play both piano and guitar whenever inspiration strikes. I also find peace in nature; hiking lets me breathe, reflect, and marvel at the beauty around Baguio’s rolling hills and misty trails.</p>
  <p>Today I’m studying <strong>Criminology</strong> at the University of the Cordilleras, diving into how justice works and how people can be protected. I’m passionate about making a positive impact in society.</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting. I hope this little site brings you closer to my dreams, passions, and everyday moments that light up my life.</p>
